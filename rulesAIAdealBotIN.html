        <h1>Rules for submitting works and participating in the contest.</h1>
        <h3>The contest will take place at the nearest time indicated in the post on the telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Perfect AI</a></h3>
        <p>Hello, dear user of neural networks and Telegram. These rules describe the instructions and public agreement for participation in our contest, the prize of which is a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus! These rules may change, and participants will be notified in advance on the telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Perfect AI</a>.</p>
    </header>
<main class="content">
    <p><b>Briefly: To participate in the subscription contest, upload from 1 to 7 works (jpeg, png images or mp4 videos up to 3 seconds) from public neural networks (with public generation links) to the bot and complete 1 or more sets (10 pairs of works) of testing during the contest period. The more works and sets, the more chances. Good luck!</b></p>
    <p style="color: green;">Questions of research purity and test safety:</p>
    <p style="color: green;">1. The time to choose works is limited to 15 seconds. During the raffle, the time for choice may be shorter. The exact amount of time will be announced additionally before the contest period starts.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">2. Bot restart is disabled, but in case of disconnection from the test due to poor internet, it may restart automatically. The choice timer does not stop during such restart.</p>

        <h1>1. Uploading and contest of works.</h1>
        <p>1.1. You can upload up to 7 (seven) works – jpg (jpeg), png images and mp4 videos up to 3 seconds, preferably with horizontal resolution.</p>
        <p>1.2. Each work uploaded by you must be generated exclusively in a public neural network.</p>
        <p>1.3. The work must be free from manual edits in graphic editors. We all want to see what neural networks are capable of.</p>
        <p>1.4. Works can be sent compressed or as files. Works must include ⚠️a public generation link <b>(mandatory)⚠️</b>. Name of the neural network, extra contact, description – welcome!</p>
        <p>1.5. Works are checked manually since no AI is yet capable of distinguishing real works from generations.</p>
        <p>1.6. Approved works – number of works and owner appear in the post on the telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Perfect AI</a> the next day after submission.</p>
        <p>1.7. Approved works sent after the deadline for the current contest will be included in a later contest.</p>
        <p>1.8. The contest will be held at the scheduled time indicated in the post on the <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Perfect AI</a> channel. Works can be added at any time.</p>
        <p>1.9. Uploading images or videos is considered an application to participate in the contest of works.</p>
        <p>1.10. If none or some of your works were not approved, we will notify you and suggest sending new ones.</p>
        <p>1.11. Each work participates in the contest once during the contest period.</p>
        <p>1.12. Works are added by us into the bot in sets of 10 generations and 10 real shots (10 choice pairs). New sets are announced by the telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Perfect AI</a>.</p>
        <p>1.13. Works in the set are randomly mixed, so it may be a comparison of image and video.</p>
        <p>1.14. The winning work (generation) will be the one most often chosen as real at 23:59 on the last day of the contest.</p>
          
    </main>
<main class="content">
        <h1>2. Participation in the main contest.</h1>
        <p>2.1. A Telegram user who has fulfilled all the conditions of these rules can participate in the main contest, the winner of which will receive a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus.</p>
        <p>2.1.1. <b>To participate in the main contest, a Telegram user must upload from 1 (one) to 7 (seven) works to the bot at least 3 days before the end of the contest and complete at least 1 (one) test set during the same contest.</b></p>
        <p>2.2. Participation in the testing contest is considered as pressing the "Start test" button in the bot during the contest period and selecting works.</p>
        <p>2.3. After starting the test, each participant receives two pictures or videos with buttons. From the pair of works, <b>the correct answer (+1 point) is the work that is NOT generated by artificial intelligence.</b></p>
        <p>2.4. The participant must independently compare the works and press the button under the one that, in their opinion, is NOT generated by a neural network.</p>
        <p>2.5. For each correct answer in a pair, the participant receives 1 point. After each choice, a bot message appears under the pictures indicating correctness.</p>
        <p>2.6. After choosing in 10 pairs, the participant receives their result for the set and can continue the test by pressing the "Continue" button.</p>
        <p>2.7. Works in each set of 10 pairs are chosen randomly, so an image can be compared with a video.</p>
        <p>2.8. Sets of works are added by us into the bot during the contest. One Telegram user can test each set only once during the contest period.</p>
        <p>2.9. The participant with the highest score at the end of the contest becomes the winner of the testing contest.</p>

    <main class="content">
        <h1>3. Victory and conditions.</h1>
        <p>3.1. Using obvious bugs in the bot’s operation, as well as uploading real images and videos, will be detected and considered as unfair participation in the contest.</p>
        <p>3.2. Googling works will reduce the chances of your pictures winning, so play fair. According to AI, the chance of guessing in binomial distributions is no more than 20%. We decided to count it as 50%.</p>
        <p>3.3. The winner will be announced the day after the end of the contest based on the results of both contests: the testing contest and the works contest. The announcement will be made on the <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Perfect AI</a> channel.</p>
        <p>3.4. The winner will receive a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus.</p>
        <p>3.5. It will be fun.</p>
