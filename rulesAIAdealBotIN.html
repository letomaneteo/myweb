    <h1>Rules for Uploading Works and Participating in the Contest</h1>
    <h3>The contest will take place from May 1 to May 31, 2025</h3>
    <p>Hello, dear user of neural networks and Telegram. These rules describe the instructions and public agreement for participation in our contest, with the prize being a monthly subscription to ChatGPT Plus! These rules may change, and each participant will be notified in advance.</p>
</header>

<main class="content">
    <p><b>In brief: To participate in the subscription contest, upload 1 to 7 works (images in jpeg, png, or videos in mp4 up to 3 seconds) from public AIs (with public links to the generation) to the bot by May 20, 2025, and complete 1 or more sets (10 pairs of works) for testing from May 1 to May 31, 2025. The more works and sets, the more chances you have. Good luck!</b></p>
    <p style="color: green;">Questions of research integrity and test security:</p>
    <p style="color: green;">1. The time for selecting works is limited to 15 seconds. During the draw from May 1 to May 31, there will be less time for selection. The exact amount of time will be announced before the start of the draw.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">2. The bot cannot be restarted, but it may automatically restart during a test if there's a poor internet connection. The selection time does not stop during such a restart.</p>

    <h1>1. Uploading and Contesting Works</h1>
    <p>1.1. You can upload up to 7 works — images in jpg (jpeg), png, and videos in mp4 up to 3 seconds, preferably with horizontal resolution — by May 20, 2025, inclusive.</p>
    <p>1.2. Each work you upload must be generated exclusively by a public neural network.</p>
    <p>1.3. The work must be free from manual edits in graphic editors. We all want to see what neural networks can do.</p>
    <p>1.4. Works can be sent compressed or as files. Add a public link to the generation <b>(mandatory)</b> with the work. The neural network's name, your contact information, and descriptions are welcome!</p>
    <p>1.5. Works are checked manually since no AI is currently able to distinguish between real works and generated ones.</p>
    <p>1.6. Approved works — the number of works and the owner — will be posted on the Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Ideal AI</a> the day after submission.</p>
    <p>1.7. Approved works submitted before May 20 will be part of the contest in May 2025.</p>
    <p>1.8. The contest will run from May 1 to May 31, 2025. Works can be added until May 20, 2025, inclusive. Works submitted after May 20 will participate in the June 2025 contest.</p>
    <p>1.9. Uploading images or videos is considered an application for participation in the contest.</p>
    <p>1.10. If none of your works are approved, we will notify you and suggest submitting new ones.</p>
    <p>1.11. Each work participates in the contest once per month.</p>
    <p>1.12. Works are added to the bot by us in sets of 10 works and 10 real photos (10 pairs for selection). This will be announced immediately on the Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Ideal AI</a>.</p>
    <p>1.13. Works in a set are shuffled randomly, so images may be compared to videos.</p>
    <p>1.14. The work that is selected as real most often by 11:59 PM on May 31, 2025, will win.</p>

    <h1>2. Participation in the Main Contest</h1>
    <p>2.1. To participate in the main contest, where the winner will receive a monthly subscription to ChatGPT Plus, a Telegram user must fulfill all the conditions outlined in these rules.</p>
    <p>2.1.1. <b>To participate in the main contest, the Telegram user must upload from 1 (one) to 7 (seven) works to the bot by May 20 and complete at least 1 (one) set of testing from May 1 to May 31.</b></p>
    <p>2.2. Participation in the test contest is achieved by clicking the "Start Test" button in the bot from May 1 to May 31 and selecting works.</p>
    <p>2.3. After starting the test, each participant receives two pictures or videos with buttons. The correct answer (+1 point) is the work that was NOT generated by artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>2.4. The participant must compare the works themselves and click the button under the one that they believe was NOT generated by AI.</p>
    <p>2.5. For each correct answer, the participant receives 1 point. After each choice, a message will appear below the pictures indicating whether the choice was correct.</p>
    <p>2.6. After completing 10 pairs of works, the participant will receive their result for the set and can continue the test by pressing the "Continue" button.</p>
    <p>2.7. The works in each set of 10 pairs are randomly chosen, so images may be compared to videos.</p>
    <p>2.8. Sets of works are added to the bot by us during the contest until May 21, 2025. A Telegram user can test each set only once.</p>
    <p>2.9. The participant with the most points at the end of the month will be declared the winner of the test contest.</p>
</main>

<main class="content">
    <h1>3. Winning and Conditions</h1>
    <p>3.1. Using obvious bugs in the bot's work, as well as uploading real images and videos, will be detected and considered by us as unfair participation in the contest.</p>
    <p>3.2. Googling works will reduce the chances of your pictures winning, so play fairly. According to AI, the chance of guessing correctly in any binomial distribution is no more than 20%. However, we decided to assume it's 50%.</p>
    <p>3.3. The winner will be announced on June 1, 2025, based on the results of both contests: the test contest and the works contest. The announcement will be made on the <a href="https://t.me/AIIdealBotChannel" target="_blank">Ideal AI</a> channel.</p>
    <p>3.4. The winner will receive a monthly subscription to ChatGPT Plus.</p>
    <p>3.5. It will be fun!</p>
